"""The tool catalog: what Jevme can do, how Jev is asked about it, and how each runs.

A Tool has:
  - name, description (`what`), examples: fed to Jev as the intent Choice criteria
  - enum args: each becomes a speculative Choice in the same Jev request
  - an optional free-text arg: filled by span selection over the tail of the utterance
  - run(args) -> short human label for the overlay
