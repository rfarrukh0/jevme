"""General computer use: observe the screen, choose one action, act, repeat until the goal is met.

Each step is a single Jev request over the front window's accessibility tree:
  op        which operation (click / type / key / scroll / open app / done / stuck)
  target    which on-screen element, for click and type
  text      which span of the user's words to type (never generated), or __compose__
  key/app   speculative enum arguments
  done      has the goal been achieved on the screen as it is now?
No screenshots and no LLM in the loop. Claude is consulted only to compose free text the user did not
dictate ("reply saying I'll be late"), and, through the vision fallback, when the tree is empty.
