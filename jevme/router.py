"""Turn a stream of partial transcripts into ordered actions.

Two stages, kept separate:

  DECIDE (this file)   partial → one Jev request (intent + speculative args) → pick a PATH and enqueue it.
  EXECUTE (main queue) run enqueued units one at a time via `execute_clause` / `run_tool`.

Every completed command takes exactly one of these paths:

  · cancel / chat / not_yet   → nothing.
  · shortcut (a built-in tool) → enqueue the tool. Fires mid-sentence once stable (the reactive path).
  · plan (several clauses)     → enqueue each clause in order.
  · agent (a screen task)      → enqueue the clause; the agent reasons over the accessibility tree.
  · learn (no app can do it)   → write a new tool (codegen), then run it.

Three triggers decide WHEN a command is ready to act, all funnelling into `_hand_off` or `_commit`:
  · stable shortcut          — the same confident tool across two partials (or a brief pause).
  · streamed leading clause  — a complete clause followed by a conjunction, fired while still talking.
  · settle                   — a pause after the sentence ends, for the plan / agent / learn paths.

Free-text arguments (a search query, a note title) are *selected* from the utterance by Jev, never
generated, so nothing is invented. Memory (see.recall, task recipes) is an accelerator inside the
agent path, not a separate path.
