**Talk to your Mac and it does it — in any app, while you're still talking.**

> "open chrome and go to youtube and play lofi beats"
> "in discord go to the general channel"
> "open the second tab" · "click the subscribe button" · "zoom in" · "implement the solution"

A floating pill shows what it hears. Commands fire as each clause lands, not after you stop. Every routine
decision is made by a fast classifier (TypeSafe **Jev**, ~200 ms); an LLM (Claude **Haiku** / **Opus**) is
only called when something genuinely needs reasoning — and whatever it figures out is **memoized**, so the
next time that same thing is a 200 ms classification instead of a multi-second model call. It gets faster and
cheaper the more you use it.

---

## Setup

### Requirements

- macOS 14+ (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (installs Python 3.12 for you)
- A **TypeSafe API key** (required) — [typesafe.ai](https://typesafe.ai)
- An **Anthropic API key** (recommended) — [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).
  Without it jevme falls back to the signed-in `claude` CLI if you have Claude Code installed (slower).

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielyedaniel/jevme.git
cd jevme
./run.sh setup          # installs deps, creates .env from .env.example, checks keys + permissions
```

Open `.env` and paste your keys:

```ini
TYPESAFE_API_KEY=ts_...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

`.env` is git-ignored. If you'd rather keep keys out of the checkout entirely, put the same file at
`~/.config/jevme/.env` instead — jevme reads both (the repo `.env` first), and real environment variables
override either.

### Permissions

Grant these to the app you launch jevme from (Terminal, iTerm, VS Code…) in
**System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security**:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| Microphone, Speech Recognition | live transcription (macOS prompts on first run) |
| Accessibility | reading on-screen controls, clicking, typing, key presses |
| Screen Recording | the screenshot fallback, when an app exposes no controls |

Check everything at any time with `./run.sh doctor`. It tests each permission and key (it even makes one live
Jev call) and tells you exactly what to fix.

Prefer jevme to own its permissions instead of your terminal? Build an app bundle:
`./scripts/make_app.sh && open dist/Jevme.app`.

### Run

```bash
./run.sh start     # start in the background
./run.sh log       # tail the log (kept across restarts in ~/Library/Logs/jevme/)
./run.sh stop
uv run jevme       # or run in the foreground
```

A waveform icon in the menu bar pauses / resumes / quits. The pill's ■ button pauses too; drag it anywhere.
Say **"stop"** at any time to cancel what's queued and running.

### Try it without a microphone

```bash
uv run jevme-replay                                        # a demo sentence through real Jev, tools dry-run
uv run jevme-replay "open spotify and play drake"          # your own sentence, dry-run
uv run jevme-replay --live "open notes and make a new note called groceries"
uv run python -m jevme.evalrun                             # routing eval: 68 utterances against real Jev
uv run pytest                                              # unit tests (no network, no mic)
```

## How it works

```
 mic ─► Apple Speech ─► Router ───────────────► ordered task queue ─► executors
        streaming        DECIDE: what did they    EXECUTE, in spoken order:
        partials         say, and is it done?       1. shortcut tool      (~0 ms after decide)
        ~150 ms          one Jev call per partial   2. replay a memo      (Jev match + tree lookups)
                         ~200 ms                    3. agent loop         (Jev per step, ~0.5 s/step)
                                                    4. write a new tool   (Opus, once; then it's a shortcut)
                                                    ↳ vision fallback     (Haiku, only when the tree is blind)
```

### 1. Listening (`jevme/speech.py`, `jevme/vocab.py`)

Apple's `SFSpeechRecognizer` streams partial transcripts every ~150 ms. On its own it only knows common
English, so the names you actually say get turned into ordinary words ("Two Sum" came out as "Tucson" and
"twosome"). jevme **personalizes the recognizer** with a live vocabulary (`contextualStrings`), most specific
first:

1. **What's on screen now:** names of the buttons, links, tabs and menu items in the front window, refreshed
   when the window changes. While LeetCode is open, "Two Sum" is expected.
2. **Your words:** names from commands that worked before (sites, apps, click targets, searches), learned UI
   targets, saved recipes and learned tools, stored locally in `~/.config/jevme/vocab.json`.
3. **General names:** well-known sites, your installed apps, command words.

A recognition request's vocabulary is fixed when it starts, so jevme opens a fresh one with the new
vocabulary at a quiet moment, never while you're mid-sentence. The same on-screen names also go to Jev,
so "open two sum" is routed as a click on that link. Only short labels of standard controls are used,
never text fields, message contents, timestamps or counts. Set `JEVME_SCREEN_VOCAB=0` to turn the screen
layer off.

### 2. Deciding (`jevme/router.py`)

Every partial is sent to Jev as **one request** containing several typed questions at once:

- **intent** — a Choice over every tool in the catalog, plus `not_yet` (still talking), `chat`,
  `general` (a screen task for the agent), `unsupported` (needs a new tool) and `cancel`.
- **args** — for each tool's enum arguments (which app? which site?), asked speculatively in the same call.
- **text spans** — free-text arguments are *selected* from the utterance ("search for **cats**"), never
  generated. Jev picks the span; no model writes it.

Not every partial needs a call: an obviously unfinished fragment ("go to the", "search for") isn't asked
about unless you pause on it, and text Jev just answered (a punctuation-only revision) reuses that answer.
On the usage logs, that removes roughly a third of the calls.

A decision **commits** when it's confident (≥ 0.8) and stable: instant tools fire when the same answer repeats
on two partials; tools that carry text wait for a short pause or the end of the sentence. Guards learned from
real usage logs:

- **Incomplete phrases wait** — "send a message to…", "search for…", a lone "open" are held until more
  arrives; "zoom in", "bold that", "send it" are recognized as complete.
- **Stale decisions don't fire** — if you kept talking while Jev was answering ("and play" → "and play
  Drake"), the decision is about old text and is re-asked instead of acting.
- **Tails are absorbed** — "close this" can commit a beat before "tab" arrives; a short trailing fragment
  that isn't a command of its own is folded into what just ran instead of pressing Tab.
- **Transcript revisions are survived** — Apple rewrites earlier words; the cursor is anchored by word
  count and the last consumed words, not a character offset.

### 3. Acting while you talk

Say "open chrome **and** go to youtube **and** search for lofi". The router splits at conjunctions followed by a
command verb and **streams** each completed leading clause into the queue *while you're still speaking*:
Chrome opens on "and go", YouTube on "and search". A single ordered worker (`jevme/main.py`) runs units one at
a time, so commands execute in the order spoken. "Stop" bumps a cancel epoch that drops everything queued so
far — and nothing said afterwards.

### 4. Executing — cheapest tier first

**Shortcuts** (`jevme/tools.py`) — 35 built-in tools: open/quit apps, open sites, Google or site search,
play a YouTube video, click/type by description, media keys, tabs, volume, dark mode, screenshot… Each is a
name, a one-line description, spoken examples, and a `run`. Add one and it's in the next Jev request.

**The agent** (`jevme/agent.py`) — anything else done through app windows. Each step:

1. Read the front window through macOS Accessibility (`jevme/ax.py`): every visible button, link, field, row
   and tab with label and position, in 20–250 ms. **No screenshot.** Chrome and Electron apps (Discord,
   Slack, VS Code, Spotify, Notion) are switched into full accessibility automatically.
2. One Jev request picks the next operation (click / type / key / scroll / open app / open URL / done /
   stuck), the target element, the key, and the words to type — all in one call.
3. Do it, look again. Up to 12 steps, ~0.5 s each.

Before reasoning, deterministic goal understanding puts the task in the right place: a message with no app
named goes to Messages; "compose a Gmail email" or "my messages on LinkedIn" goes to the **website**, never
the look-alike native app. If the agent makes no progress for 5 steps it escalates to vision, then stops.

**Writing new tools** (`jevme/generator.py`, `jevme/learned.py`) — requests no window can satisfy ("make the
screen brighter", "delete the selected note") make Opus write a small AppleScript / JXA / shell tool. It must
pass a hard policy (no sudo, wiping, credentials, system paths), a syntax compile, and a Jev review ("would this
really do it?") before it runs. It's then saved and becomes a shortcut forever.

**Vision fallback** (`jevme/vision.py`) — when an app exposes no usable controls (canvas apps, games, remote
desktops) or the agent is stuck, Haiku looks at a screenshot of the front window and returns one action with
pixel coordinates.

**Composing** — only when you ask for content ("implement the solution", "reply thanking her", "summarize
this"), the agent reads the *full* window text (`ax.deep_text`: the actual problem, email or code, not just
labels) and Opus writes it; long or multi-line output is pasted so editors don't mangle indentation. "Compose
a new message" opens an empty one — it never invents words you didn't ask for.

---

## Memoization: the slow path teaches the fast path

The core design rule: **Jev classifies, models reason, and every reasoning result is stored as a case Jev can
classify next time.** There are five memories, all local in `~/.config/jevme/`:

| Memory | Learned from | Replayed by | Cost the 2nd time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UI cases** `ui_memory.json` | a Jev pick over the whole tree, or a Haiku screenshot click | one Jev Choice matching your words to known intents in this app, then a live-tree lookup | ~130 ms instead of ~1.5–6 s |
| **Task recipes** `task_memory.json` | an agent run that *verifiably* finished | one Jev Choice matching the goal to past goals; each step resolved from the live tree | no per-step reasoning |
| **Workflows** `workflows.json` | the same safe sequence of successful top-level tasks recurring three times | a named Jev tool which runs each tool or live-tree recipe in order | no new reasoning |
| **Learned tools** `learned.json` | Opus writing a script | Jev routes to it like any built-in tool | 0 model calls |
| **Demonstrations** → `task_memory.json` | you doing it by hand after a command failed | same as recipes | no model ever involved |

### What makes a memo trustworthy

A memory that replays the wrong thing is worse than none, so everything is filtered on the way in:

- **Only verified successes** become recipes (the agent explicitly chose done, or was ≥ 0.9 sure). A run
  that merely ran out of ideas teaches nothing.
- **Only stable targets** are memorized: named controls (buttons, links, tabs, fields…). Chat bubbles,
  timestamps, field values, live counts ("1 Reply"), and long descriptions are rejected.
- **Volatile goals aren't replayed** — messaging/sending, where the recipient and content differ each time.
- **Page-relative requests are never cached** — "the second video" is resolved fresh every time.
- **Replays are checked live** — a memo is used only if Jev says the request matches *and* the element is on
  screen now. If a step can't be resolved (the UI changed), the agent takes over from that point and re-learns.

### Templates, not transcripts

Recipes generalize. Text you typed is stored as a slot tied to the words of the goal, so a recipe learned for
"search discord for **cats**" replays "search discord for **dogs**" by reading the new value off the new goal.
The same applies to targets you named: "open my **cs 343** notes" → clicks the **CS 341** row when you say it.

### Repeated routines → saved workflows

When two or more safe completed tasks recur in the same order, Jevme can suggest saving the routine after
three occurrences. Say **"save workflow as morning standup"** to name it; later, **"run morning standup"**
runs its tools and live-tree recipes in order. Detection uses only successful replayable descriptors, is
bounded into short activity episodes, and survives restarts in `~/.config/jevme/workflows.json`.

Workflow learning never watches global input. It excludes typed content, volatile messaging, consequential
actions, failed tasks, and workflow replays themselves. Mining is off by default; set
`JEVME_WORKFLOW_LEARNING=1` to opt in. Disabling it does not disable workflows you already saved.

### Learning from demonstration (`jevme/watch.py`)

When the agent fails, the pill says *"show me, I'll learn it"* and jevme watches you do it by hand — the
cleanest possible training pair (exact goal → exact steps, no model guessing). It records the **role and label**
of each control you click, menu paths ("View > Zoom In"), and named keys/shortcuts. It **never records what you
type**: a field's text is kept only if it's words you just spoke in the command; otherwise the demonstration is
discarded. Password fields are never read. Recording ends after 7 s of inactivity, when you speak the next
command, or on "stop" (which discards it).

## Model optimization

Each decision goes to the cheapest thing that can make it correctly.

| Job | Model | Why | Typical latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Routing every partial, arg extraction, span selection | **Jev** (TypeSafe System One) | calibrated probabilities for typed Choice / yes-no questions; many questions batched in one request | 150–400 ms |
| Next agent step, element picks, memo matching | **Jev** | same — picking among listed options is classification, not generation | ~200 ms |
| "Where do I click?" when the tree is blind | **Claude Haiku 4.5** + screenshot | fast, cheap vision; used only as a fallback | ~1.5 s (first call ~6 s) |
| Writing code, replies, summaries; writing new tools | **Claude Opus 5** | real reasoning over page content; called once per request | 5–20 s |

Techniques that keep it fast and cheap:

- **Memoize every model result into a Jev case** (above) — the expensive path runs once per distinct thing.
- **Batch questions.** Intent, every enum arg, and the text span are one Jev request, not a chain.
- **Speculative args.** Args for every tool are asked alongside the intent, so a commit needs no second call.
- **Accessibility tree before pixels.** Reading controls takes 20–250 ms and costs nothing; a screenshot + vision
  call is the exception.
- **Structured outputs for vision.** Haiku replies against a strict JSON schema (`output_config.format`), so
  there's no text repair and no slow retry path.
- **Deterministic rules before any model** — app inference, site-name snapping ("leetcod.com" → leetcode.com),
  incomplete-phrase detection, and safety policy are plain code.
- **Stream, don't wait.** Acting on completed clauses mid-sentence hides most latency behind your own speech.
- **Warm apps ahead of time.** Chromium/Electron accessibility is switched on when an app comes to the front,
  so its tree is ready before you speak.

Models are configurable: `JEVME_VISION_MODEL`, `JEVME_CODEGEN_MODEL` (see `.env.example`).

---

## Safety

- **Nothing consequential without asking.** The agent and vision won't click Submit, Send, Post, Buy/Pay,
  Delete or Sign out unless your words ask for it. Learned tools that delete, send, pay, or change settings
  wait for a spoken "yes" — every time they run.
- **Generated scripts are gated** by a hard policy, a compile check, and a Jev review, and re-checked on load.
  Spoken values are passed to scripts as data (environment variables / escaped literals), never spliced in as code.
- **Keystroke rate guard** caps synthetic key presses so a runaway loop can't flood the machine.
- **Everything is local** except the API calls themselves. Delete `~/.config/jevme/` to forget everything learned.

## Configuration

All optional, via `.env` or environment: `JEVME_COMMIT_CONFIDENCE` (0.80), `JEVME_STABLE_PARTIALS` (2),
